One cloudy summer evening looking east from my window at sunset I noticed a fire in the sky
glowing brilliantly and creating an unreal atmosphere. This clearly wasn't
the sun hiding behind a cloud as I was looking east and the sun was setting in the
west. Checking the photo timestamp against an 
[ephemeris](https://www.timeanddate.com/sun/singapore/singapore?month=5&year=2020)
I later discovered the sun had actually about five minutes earlier.

This effect interestingly is caused by the curvature of the earth. While the sun may have 
already set beneath the jorizon and no longer be visible to an observer on the ground,
clouds high in the sky may still catch rays of the sun since the horizon is further 
away the higher up you are. This effect combined with a lucky shape & orientation of the
cloud then was the explanation for the fire in the sky.

The same effect can be observed for a fleeting minute or so in sky-scrapers where the 
sun sets earlier for the lower floors than the upper floors. You can see this effect
in this photo of a Toronto Sunset
