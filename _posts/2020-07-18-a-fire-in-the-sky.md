One cloudy summer evening looking east I noticed an brilliant
fire in the sky. This clearly wasn't the sun hiding behind a cloud
because I was looking east while the sun was setting in the west.
Checking [later](https://www.timeanddate.com/sun/singapore/singapore?month=5&year=2020),
I discovered the sun had actually set five minutes before this photo
was taken.

This is caused by the curvature of the earth. While the sun may have 
already set below the horizon for someone standing on the ground, clouds
high in the sky may still catch rays of the sun since the horizon is further 
away the higher up you go.

You can observe the same effect for a fleeting minute in skyscrapers. The sun
sets earlier for lower floors than upper floors. If skies are clear and you're
looking at just the right moment, you may be able to see a wave of darkness racing
up the skyscraper. You can see the effect in this photo of a Toronto sunset.
