Mukteshwara temple in Bhubhaneshwar is an exquisitely carved and pictueresque small
Oriya temple.  Itâ€™s compactness almost makes it look like a perfect toy temple.
The site is protected by Archeological Survey of India. I noticed this old pilgrim
taking a dip in the in the small tank behind the temple. Taken with a HTC camera phone.
