I took this pic of my friend Moi on a cycling trip in Normandy. I'm quite proud of
the composition in this pic :-)  The road narrows into the distance in the centre;
the left part of the pic has a slightly dramatic band of leafless deciduous trees
and Moi strikes a pose on the right on his cycle.  A group of us on a daytrip to
Normandy hired bicycles at Bayeux of the [tapestry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayeux_Tapestry)
fame to cycle down to the D-Day Beaches. We loved cycling in the quiet rustic tree-lined
roads of the rural French countryside. We visited Omaha beach and the 
[US War cemetry]("http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normandy_American_Cemetery_and_Memorial")
that features in the Speilberg movie Saving Private Ryan. We later calculated using maps
that we must have cycled 50-60km that day as we avoided the busy (and very dangerous to
cyclists) expressway and took the meandering countryside roads instead. Of course we
paid for it by hobbling around our hostel for the next two days :-)
