A really interesting experience from my college days at IIM Ahmedabad
was a bike trip to the [Little Rann of Kutch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Rann_of_Kutch).
Once we were inside the Rann proper, utterly flat parched dry land stretched horizon to
horizon and we began seeing mirages. We ran into a couple of camel caravans.

My college friend [Hitanshu](https://twitter.com/free_rider) was the leading light
in organizing quite a few bike trips around Ahemedabad. Apart from the ride to 
the Rann, I recall joining trips to [Patan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patan,_Gujarat),
[Nal Sarovar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nal_Sarovar_Bird_Sanctuary) and 
[Thol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thol_Lake) bird sanctuaries - invariably riding pillion.
