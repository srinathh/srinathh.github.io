In 2014 when I visited Toronto, Canada for a work meeting, my then manager
took a whole day off to take me to see the Niagra falls. It was a chilly but sunny 
day, wonderful weather for photography. I caught a beautiful 
[double rainbow](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/weather/learn-about/weather/optical-effects/rainbows/double-rainbows)
on the Canadian side of the falls - notice how the sequence of colors invert
themselves between the two rainbows.

A noisy [Ring-billed gull](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring-billed_gull) also made an 
appearance on the parapet wall next to me.

It turns out that my timing was perfect. Barely a few days I returned, North America was hit by
a [massive snow-storm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/November_13%E2%80%9321,_2014_North_American_winter_storm)
that buried the places I had walked around casually under many feet of snow!
