This article shows you how to correctly build 
[React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) components,
especially container components in a modular and flexible way
such that they can be used with customization across apps 
and use cases without having to modify the component code.

While React makes it very simple to create composable
components, providing flexibility for varying use cases by
apps consuming the components requires care in consuming only
properties explicitly supported and passing on the remaining
ones to the underlying DOM elements. In this article, we will
explore best practices integrated from multiple sources to
achieve this goal. 

All code for this article is [available on Github](https://github.com/srinathh/build-react-container-component)

Motivation
----------
I learned many of these techniques while trying to wrap
[Material Components for Web](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web)
into re-usable React components. The project is called
[reactmdcweb](https://github.com/srinathh/reactmdcweb) hosted
on Github.


Expected Outcome
----------------
We will build a container component like the picture below. It 
is a colored box that spans the available width and contains
children that will have left-aligned text. The parent must specify
a title which is center aligned. The component will be flexible
and modular allowing event binding & style overrides by the app
using the component in ways that differ from the original design.

Pre-Requisites
--------------
- Prior Familiarity with React
- [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) installed on your dev machine
- Familiarity with [ES6 syntax](http://ccoenraets.github.io/es6-tutorial/)

Steps
-----
### 1. Bootstrap a new React Project
We will use the Create React App tool to bootstrap a new React 
Project with all our required libraries & development dependencies
like BabelJS, Webpack and its loaders etc.

```shell
create-react-app build-react-container-component
```

### 2. Check that the initial demo builds
Start the development server 

```shell
npm start
```
If everything installed properly, you shold see a screen like
the one below showing the initial demo screen of create react
app. We will use the phone device browser emulation in Chrome
for easier reviews and debugging. 

![Initial create react app demo screen](/assets/images/modular-react-components/base_cra_screen.png){:class="zoompic"}

### 3. Create the styling of our container
We will begin creating the styles for our container component.
Our container will be a `<div>` with a firebrick red background
and white text spanning the full available width with some 
padding. Create the file `src/myContainer.css` and add the
following style to the file.

```css
div.MyContainer {
  width: "100%";
  background-color: firebrick;
  color: white;
  padding: 16px;  
}
```

### 4. Create a basic container component using the above style
In `src/myContainer.js` create the following React container
component which is basically a `<div>` on which we apply the
styles we defined earlier. This container expects a title
which will be displayed with a `<h1>` tag separated from
the `<div>` containing other child components by a 
horizontal ruler `<hr>`. Child components are added using
`{this.props.children}`.

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import './myContainer.css'

export default class MyContainer extends React.Component{
    render(){
        return(
            <div className='MyContainer'>
                <h1>{this.props.title}</h1>
                <hr />
                <div>
                    {this.props.children}
                </div>
            </div>
        )
    }
}
```

### 5. Let's test our container component
Let's wipe out some of the Create React App boilerplate 
in `src/App.js` and test our own component instead. We
need to first `import MyContainer` and use it. We will
pass a title and add two children - an image & a _Lorem
Ipsum_ div. 

```jsx
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import logo from './logo.svg';
import './App.css';
import MyContainer from './myContainer'

class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="App">
        <MyContainer title="Super Container!">
            <img style={{width:"200px"}} src={logo} alt="logo" />
            <div>
                Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur 
                adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor 
                incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.
            </div>
        </MyContainer>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default App;
```
The outcome should look like the picture below with the red
card like container `<div>` taking up the full width available
but only as much height as required for the children plus
padding.

### 6. Adding Type Checking on Props
It's good developmental practice to ensure the props we 
want to consume have the type we expect. React provides 
a [PropTypes](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/typechecking-with-proptypes.html)
mechanism to type check props during development.
This is stripped out in optimized production builds. Let's
add type checking for `string` for the the `title` prop 
in `src/myContainer.js`.
 
```jsx
import React from 'react'
import './myContainer.css'

export default class MyContainer extends React.Component{
    static propTypes = {
        title: React.PropTypes.string
    }

    render(){
        return(
            <div className='MyContainer'>
                <h1>{this.props.title}</h1>
                <hr />
                <div>
                    {this.props.children}
                </div>
            </div>
        )
    }
}
```

### 7. Flexibility: Allowing DOM properties & event binding
Suppose the programmer consuming our custom component wanted
to let his users click on the container and capture the event.
They would try to bind to the onClick event on our container
like below in `src/App.js`. However, the expected console
message won't show up if we do this.

```jsx
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import logo from './logo.svg';
import './App.css';
import MyContainer from './myContainer'

class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="App">
        <MyContainer 
            title="Super Container!" 
            onClick={e=>console.log("card clicked")}
        >
            <img style={{width:"200px"}} src={logo} alt="logo" />
            <div>
                Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur 
                adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor 
                incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.
            </div>
        </MyContainer>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default App;
```

This fails because the original creator of the container did not
anticipate that a user will want to bind to the onClick event 
and did not provide for a way to do so. He merely wanted the
component to be used as a container for other things.

However, as a container component developer, we can still 
take advantage of ES6 semantics to provide a simple way to
pass on un-anticipated props and event bindings to the `<div>`
by the approach below in `src/myContainer.js`

Here, we use the experimental [destructuring assignment](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment)
syntax to extract the props we are directly using in our 
component (ie. `title` and `children` and bundle the 
remaining properties and event bindings into `{...other}`
which gets passed on to the root `<div>` using the `...`
[spread operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_operator). 
Both the spread operator and the 
destructuring assignment are supported in the Create
React App setup by default.  

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import './myContainer.css'

export default class MyContainer extends React.Component{
    static propTypes = {
        title: React.PropTypes.string
    }
    render(){
        const {title, children, ...other} = this.props
        return(
            <div className='MyContainer' {...other}>
                <h1>{title}</h1>
                <hr />
                <div>
                    {children}
                </div>
            </div>
        )
    }
}
```

On doing this, you will find that the `onClick` event is 
firing and producing logging in the console. This is because
the `onClick` event binding has been passed on to the 
root `<div>` of the component using the `{...other}`.

### 8: Flexibility: Allowing overriding style classes
Let's say the user wants a dark green background instead of
the firebrick red background. Knowing how CSS3 works, he
notices that the container component is styled by a style
class named 'MyContainer'. So he adds a style tied to 
a more specific selector class in his `src/App.css` like
below.

```css
div.MyContainer.greenbg{
    background-color: seagreen
}
```
He then uses it in `src/App.js` to try to override the
firebrick red background in `MyContainer`.

```jsx
<MyContainer 
    title="Super Container!" 
    onClick={e=>console.log("card clicked")}
    className="greenbg"
>
```
This unfortunately causes us to lose the background 
color entirely due to the overriding class not being
handled correctly in our component.

![bad classname handing](/assets/images/modular-react-components/bad_classname.png){:class="zoompic"}

To fix this, we need to handle the `className` prop in our
component and append it to any existing classes we are 
already using. We will use the excellent `classnames` 
module to do this - so first we need to install it.

```shell
npm install --save classnames
```

Now here below, we extract the `className` passed to us if any
using the destructuring assignment syntax and then append
it to the existing `MyContainer` class we use. This allows
the `greenbg` class to override only the `background-color`
property and not mess with other settings from `MyContainer`
like padding and text color white.

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import './myContainer.css'
import classNames from 'classnames'

export default class MyContainer extends React.Component{
    static propTypes = {
        title: React.PropTypes.string
    }
    render(){
        const {title, children, className, ...other} = this.props

        const classnames = classNames(
            'MyContainer',
            className
        )

        return(
            <div className={classnames} {...other}>
                <h1>{title}</h1>
                <hr />
                <div>
                    {children}
                </div>
            </div>
        )
    }
}
```

This results in the correct background color being applied.

### 9: Flexibility: Adding a class to children
Sometimes, a container class needs to add styles and classes
to all its children. As a practical example, the [Card Actions](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web/tree/master/packages/mdc-card#actions)
section in Material Components for Web requires us to add
a class called `mdc-card__action` to all child buttons.

In our case, we will style all children of our component
to have their text left aligned. To do this, let's first
go into `src/myContainer.css` and add the following style.

```css
.childStyle{
    text-align: left
}
```

To apply this style to all the children, we need to first
iterate through the children. Due to the special nature of
the `children` props, we need to use the [React.Children.map](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/react-api.html#react.children.map)
function provided by React to iterate through them.

```jsx
const newChildren = React.Children.map(this.props.children, child=>{
})
```

For each child, we need to first extract any existing classes
by accessing `child.props.className`. We then use our `classNames`
trick to add the our `childStyle` class and assign the combined
classes to a string. 

```jsx
const childclassnames = classNames(
    child.props.className,
    'childStyle'
)
```

Finally we clone the `props` of the child replacing the `className`
with our revised class string using `Object.assign` and then
clone the React component itself using the revised props. In
the component, we use the cloned children instead.

```jsx
const newprops = Object.assign({},child.props,{className:childclassnames})
return React.cloneElement(child, newprops)
```

Here is the full revised code.

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import './myContainer.css'
import classNames from 'classnames'

export default class MyContainer extends React.Component{
    static propTypes = {
        title: React.PropTypes.string
    }
    render(){
        const {title, children, className, ...other} = this.props

        const classnames = classNames(
            'MyContainer',
            className
        )

        const newChildren = React.Children.map(this.props.children, child=>{
            const childclassnames = classNames(
                child.props.className,
                'childStyle'
            )
            const newprops = Object.assign({},child.props,{className:childclassnames})
            return React.cloneElement(child, newprops)
        })

        return(
            <div className={classnames} {...other}>
                <h1>{title}</h1>
                <hr />
                <div>
                    {newChildren}
                </div>
            </div>
        )
    }
}
```

This should result in children text being left aligned.
