I saw this expressive stature of Mary and Jesus at Notre Dame de la Garde in
Marseilles. This church is atop a hill overlooking the harbor and is 
dedicated to "Our lady of the Watch" - the traditional guardian of seafarers. 
The church with its gilded statue of Mary and Infant Jesus dominates the
skyline of Marseilles. Its interiors are covered with offerrings from
devotees - most prominently model ships. The island barely visible in the
background is Chateau D'lf - the island prison made famous in the
Alexandre Dumas' novel - The Count of Monte Cristo. You can visit the old island
prison by boat on days when the water in the bay is not choppy.
