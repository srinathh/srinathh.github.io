A lazy cruise down the [Nile river](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nile) from Aswan to Luxor with 
stops at archeological sites was of the more memorable experiences my wife and I enjoyed in Egypt. 
What struck us most was the unique blend of colors on the Nile riverbank that arises due to the fact
that in much of Egypt, the civilization is but a thin cultivated strip of green on either side of 
the river in the middle of the desert under the largely cloudless blue sky.  After my wife & I 
recently reminiscenced about our trip, I tried to convert our memories of colors into the color
theme above.
