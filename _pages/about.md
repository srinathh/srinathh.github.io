I lead a team of data science & analyics professionals in Procter & Gamble
across Singapore & Guangzhou to develop the next generation of techniques to improve
marketing & sales effectiveness. Evidence based marketing and causal inference are
my long time professional areas of interest.

In terms of technology, I started early teaching myself computer programming in BASIC
from the IBM PC manuals in my father's office at the age of eleven. Though I have never
professionally worked as a programmer beyond my data science work, coding has been
my lifelong passion for over quarter of a century. I have contributed to a few open source
projects including the Go programming language.

In the field of Arts, I am a hobbyist musician and multi-instrumentalist having learned guitars,
keyboards and the indian percussion instrument called Tabla. I have interests in Photography & Design.

I am married to [Deepa](https://www.linkedin.com/in/deepa-n-swamy/), co-founder of 
[FlexiBees](https://www.flexibees.com/), a startup focused on re-employing women on a
career break through part time & remote work opportunities.
