I have been driven by curiosity since my childhood and my life took a decidedly geeky turn at the age of eleven 
when I taught myself computer programming in the BASIC Language from IBM Personal Computer manuals
in my father's office. Though I have pursued other avenues in higher education and career, coding has
been a lifelong interest for me. In recent years with the rise of data science, I have found was to 
apply these skills at work too.

I have degrees in Metallurgical Engineering ([Indian Institute of Technology, Benaras 
Hindu University, Varanasi](http://iitbhu.ac.in/)) and Management ([Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad]( http://www.iimahd.ernet.in/)).
I contributed to a [paper on steel-making](http://www.saimm.co.za/Conferences/MoltenSlags2004/077-Ekengard.pdf)
during my undergraduate internship in the Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm.

I lead a team of data science & analytics professionals across Singapore & Guangzhou to develop the
next generation of techniques to optimize marketing & sales effectiveness for [Procter & Gamble](www.pg.com)
See my [LinkedIn Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hariharan-srinath-12332113) for more details.

I am married to [Deepa](https://www.linkedin.com/in/deepa-n-swamy/) who has co-founded [FlexiBees](https://www.flexibees.com/),
a startup focused on re-employing women on a career break through part time & remote work opportunities & live in Singapore.
